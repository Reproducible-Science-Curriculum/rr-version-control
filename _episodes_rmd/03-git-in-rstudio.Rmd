Follow along demo:

1. Fork the `rr-version-control-demo` repository.
1. Clone your forked repository to obtain a local copy of the files into an `RStudio` project.
1. Edit a file in this repository/project.
1. Stage your changes to be committed.
1. View the diff, and commit your changes, with a commit message.
1. Push your changes to your own fork of the the `rr-version-control-demo` GitHub repository.

### Step 1: Fork:
Fork the [`rr-version-control-demo`](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-version-control-demo) repository.

1. Go to the repository at https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-version-control-demo.
1. Click on "Fork"" (on the top right corner).

*Now you have a copy of rr-version-control-demo repository in your account, woohoo!*

### Aside: Where am I?
How can I tell if I am looking at my fork or the original repository?

- Look at the URL.
- Look at the name of the repo on the upper left corner, for your fork it will say:
`[your-github-name]/rr-version-control-demo
forked from Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-version-control-demo`

### Step 2: Clone
Clone your forked repository to obtain a local copy of the files .

1. In `RStudio`, go to "File > New Project"
1. Click on "*Version Control: Checkout a project from a version control repository*"
1. Click on "*Git: Clone a project from a repository*"
1. Fill in the info:
  - URL: use HTTPS address
  - Create as a subdirectory of: Browse to where you would like to create this folder
  
### Step 3: Edit
Edit a file in this repository/project.

1. Open the file called `gdp-life-expectancy.Rmd` and `knit`.
1. Change the analysis_year to another year for which we have data (1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007), and knit again. Examine the output for changes.

### Step 4: Stage
Stage your changes to be committed.

1. Go to the Git pane in RStudio.
1. Stage the changes for `gdp-life-expectancy.Rmd` and gdp-life-expectancy.html by checking the boxes next to then, and hit `Commit`.

*Don't worry about the other files that appear in this pane, we'll get to them in a bit.*

### Step 5: Commit
View the diff, and commit your changes, with a commit message.

1. In the pop-up window view the diff for the `.Rmd` file. You can view it for the `.HTML` file as well if you like.
1. Enter an informative commit message, like "*Changed analysis year to X*", and hit `Commit`.

### Step 6: Push
Push your changes to your own fork of the the `rr-version-control-demo` GitHub repository.

**push**: When using git push always means pushing commits from your local respository (your computer) to a remote repository (GitHub).

1. Now push your changes to GitHub by hitting Push.
1. Enter login information as needed.

*Getting an error? Can't push? See [here](https://github.com/jennybc/stat540_2014/blob/master/seminars/seminar92_git.md) under GitHub password. Ask a helper!*


### More info on the Git pane
File tracking:

- The RStudio Git pane lists every file thatâ€™s been added, modified or deleted.

- The icon describes the change:
  - ![](../fig/rstudio-git-modified.png) **Modified** You've changed the contents of the file.
  -  ![](../fig/rstudio-git-unknown.png) **Untracked**: You've added a new file that Git hasn't seen before.
  - ![](../fig/rstudio-git-deleted.png) **Deleted**: You've deleted a file.

You can get more details about modifications with a : ![](../fig/rstudio-git-diff.png)

- Green: added text
- Red: removed text

### What's in my Git pane?

- When you cloned your repo into an RStudio project you got two bonus files that weren't there before: `.gitignore` and `.rr-version-control-demo.Rproj`
- They're both showing up as **untracked** since Git hasn't seen them before. You can stage, commit, and push those files to your repository.
- `.rr-version-control-demo.Rproj`: This file maintains metadata on the R project.
- `.gitignore`: Git uses this file to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit.
