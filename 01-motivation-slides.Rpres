========================================================

What is Version Control?
========================================================
</br>
</br>

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

## How do you record the history of your projects?

Better - Saving everything together at once
======================================================
</br>
</br>

Everytime you make a save, you zip the entire directory that your project files are in and save it with a date. 

Best - Version Control

========================================================

</br>
Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then save just 
the changes you made at each step of the way. 

You can think of it as a tape: if you 
rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play back each change 
and end up with your latest version.

=====================================================
You can then think 
about "playing back" different sets of changes onto the base document and getting 
different versions of the document.
