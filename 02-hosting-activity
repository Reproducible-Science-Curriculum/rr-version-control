# Version Control via Git and Github

Before this lesson:

-  Obtain a Github account. If you sign up using a student email you get five free private repositories through a [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
- Install Github GUI. [Github GUI Guide (Mac)](https://mac.github.com), [Github GUI Guide (Windows)](https://windows.github.com). 

After this lesson, you should be able to:

## Learning Objectives

- Define version control as a way to save 
- Recognize the difference between Git and hosting Git 
- Benefits of Git (working alone)
- Benefits of Git (collaboration) 
- Locate further resources for understanding best practices of Git

## Lesson Plan Outline

Goal:  Host `pick4country.Rmd` to Github repository. [Original Directory](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-organization1/tree/master/files/lit-prog)

Let's start by sharing the changes we've made to a directory we are familiar with: `lit-prog`.  Now that we made a beautiful Rmarkdown document, its time to host it on Github.  The reasons you host remotely, on a server like Github is to 
1. Back-up your work
2. Share work for easy collaboration
3. Show the world. 

## Activity

Let's get started 
Log in to GitHub, then click on the icon in the top right corner to create a new repository and name it lit-prog-firstName-lastName.

Name your repository "planets" and then click "Create Repository":

As soon as the repository is created,
GitHub displays a page with a URL and some information on how to configure your local repository:

The next step is to connect the two repositories. We do this by making the GitHub repository a remote for the local repository. The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string we need to identify it:

II. Activity 
    1.  Sign up for Github.  
    2.  Open the Github GUI.
    -   Set up new repo.
    -   Commit Changes. 
    -   Push to Github.
    -   Repeat 5 and 6.
    -   Partner up and pull from each other's repo.    
    -   Change the file. 
    -   Submit Pull Request.
3. Introduction to best practices and troubleshooting (Lecture-ish) (Branching, Dev. branch, CONTRIBUTING.md, Workflows, Conflicts, ect.)
