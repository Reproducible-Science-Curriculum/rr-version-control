# Version Control via Git and Github

## Lesson synopsis

This lesson teaches the concept of version control using git. There are two different activities, one using GitHub and the locally-installed GitHub GUI client and one using only GitHub. Differences between the client on OS X and Windows can make the client activities challenging.

## Syllabus

After this lesson, students should be able to:
*   Create a repository on GitHub.
*   Commit changes to files.
*   Evaluate repository History.
*   Know the difference between directory and repository.
*   Create a pull request to someone else's remote repository.

If you are using the lesson with the local GUI client, then also:
*   Initiate Git in a local project directory.
*   Push local repository to remote repository on Github.
*   Clone a remote repository.
*   Differentiate between a local and remote repository.  

## Setup

Before this lessons, students should:
-  Obtain a Github account. If you sign up using a student email you get five free private repositories through a [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
- (optional; only if using lesson 02a) Install Github GUI. [Github GUI Guide (Mac)](https://mac.github.com), [Github GUI Guide (Windows)](https://windows.github.com).

## Materials

Note that any given workshop will use either exercise 02a (GitHub plus GitHub local client) or 02b (GitHub only), not both.
